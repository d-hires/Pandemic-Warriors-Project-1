Team Members – The Pandemic Warriors! 

Sullivan Bohren, Don Hires, Laura Paschal, Jessica Pena, Saki Sugio 

 

Project Description

Hypothesis: Depression and Anxiety Cases Increase During the Covid-19 Crisis in Kansas and Missouri for High School Aged Teens and Young Adults (18-35 years). 

Research Questions to Answer 

Is there a difference in income levels when it comes to depression/anxiety increasing? 

Are there differences in well-populated areas versus suburban and rural areas? 

Is there a difference in race levels when it comes to depression/anxiety? 

What is the difference between males and females? 

Is there an increase in reaching out for therapy (maybe less because of isolation)? 

Increase in medications for depression and anxiety? 

Define the timeframe – Covid-19 time? What is our baseline data? 

Are others more prone to depression/anxiety by other members in their household? 

What amount of data may not have been reported (reporter bias) and how does that affect the data analysis/outcome? 

Have those already diagnosed with Anxiety and/or Depression increase in severity of symptoms?

# Pandemic-Warriors-Project-1 - Outline

Mental Health Effects on Teens and Young Adults During Covid-19 Crisis
Outline
1.	Introduction 
•	We are team Pandemic Warriors (insert entertaining something here)	
•	Hypothesis: Depression and Anxiety Cases Increase During the Covid-19 Crisis of Adults (18 and up) in the United States.
•	API’s used: CDC.gov, Census.gov
•	 Background information about the Survey  
(Estimates on this page are derived from the Household Pulse Survey and show the percentage of adults who report symptoms of anxiety or depression that have been shown to be associated with diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder. )
2.   “Talking about the Indicators”
•	Symptoms of Depression, Symptoms of Anxiety, Symptoms of Depression & Anxiety 
•	Explain how we chose the four sections to  find if there was an increase of symptoms
3.  “Talking about the participants” 
•	Gender: Females saw a decrease - Males saw an increase as time went on
•	Ages : 18-29 group had the most increase  (rest of the age group was too similar?)
•	Race: low Asian reported symptoms
4.  “National data and states data”
•	Comparing the national data to the states	
•	How the national data compares to Kansas & Missouri
         Show increase
5. Going forward questions—Conclusion slides
•	Did we have any outliers?
•	We could have also looked at race, income, employment status, educational disruptions, capacity to telework and travel?
•	Shortcomings of the data set provided: (4 Nonsampling errors of the Household Pulse Survey)
•	(“The Census Bureau employs quality control procedures to minimize these errors.However, the potential bias due to non-sampling errors has not yet been evaluated”)
